</center>

OmniLRS is powered by NVIDIA Isaac Sim and NVIDIA Omniverse libraries to provide visually realistic and physically accurate robotics simulation of lunar rovers.
- GPU accelerated ray tracing for real-time illumination, shadows and vision sensors
- GPU accelerated physics for real-time rigid-body dynamics and wheel/soil interactions
- Base Terrain from NASA LRO Digital Elevation Models, plus generative rock and crater distributions from power laws
- Customizable and randomizable terrain generation and asset placement for synthetic data generation
- Integration with ROS2 robotics ecosystem and more
- Multi-physics model framework to simulate the entire range of telemetry needed in lunar missions: Power, Radio, Thermal
- Mission Control Software Integration (Yamcs and Grafana) for mission operations development, training and rehearsals

## Simulation Environments Overview


|  <div style="width:70px">Name</div>  |  <div style="width:230px">Description</div>  | Images            |
|------------|-------------|---------------------------------|
| **Lunalab**            |  <div style="width:230px"> Digital-Twin of lunar analog at the University of Luxembourg. This environment also supports terrain deformation as the rover drives on it. </div> | <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/OmniLRS/OmniLRS/media/env_img/lunalab.png" width=520/> |
| **Lunaryard**            |  <div style="width:230px">A small scale procedually generated lunar environment. If lunar coordinates and a date is provided the position of the Earth and Sun are computed using ephemerides resulting in realistic lighting. This feature is also available in the large scale environments. This environment also support terrain deformation as the rover drives on it.</div>  | <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/OmniLRS/OmniLRS/media/env_img/lunaryard_husky_ex1.png" width=520/> |
| **LargeScale**           |  <div style="width:230px">Semi procedural lunar environment. It uses real DEM to reconstuct the coarse terrain, usually 5 meters per pixel and then uses procedural generation to augment it to 2.5 cm per pixel. The terrain itself can be generated at a even higher resolution to smooth out shadows. This very fine terrain allows to reconstruct fine terrain features increasing the engineering value of the sim. The whole of this is bundled inside Geometry clip maps, allowing to render very large scenes.</div> | <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/OmniLRS/OmniLRS/media/env_img/large_scale.png" width=520/>

### Dataset generation

`mode=SDG_Dataset` renders stereo (or mono) segmentation datasets with RGB, semantic and instance masks, depth,
normals and exact poses on Lunaryard or on real LOLA terrain (LargeScale); `scripts/sdg_dataset/` turns the capture
into training labels without Isaac Sim. Both halves can be used on their own. See [docs/sdg_dataset.md](docs/sdg_dataset.md),
including how to move to another lunar site.

```bash
# capture only (Isaac Sim): one shard on the default LargeScale site
python run.py mode=SDG_Dataset environment=largescale4Dataset rendering.renderer.headless=True mode.dataset_settings.base_seed=0
# post-process only (numpy, scipy, opencv-python, pyyaml): validate, then build labels and splits
python scripts/sdg_dataset/validate.py data/sdg_dataset/shard_00000 && python scripts/sdg_dataset/build.py --shards data/sdg_dataset/shard_00000 --out data/sdg_dataset_built
# both: run the capture command, then the post-process command (several shards: docs/sdg_dataset.md, "Workflow C")
```

## Installation

Follow the instruction on the Wiki: we strongly recommend following the [docker installation](https://github.com/OmniLRS/OmniLRS/wiki/Installation#docker-installation) steps.

Then Follow the [Getting Started steps](https://github.com/OmniLRS/OmniLRS/wiki/getting_started) to run your first OmniLRS simulations!

### ROS2 Integration

See the separate git repository to run the ROS2 demo. \
It supports joystick teleoperation and navigation. \
https://github.com/jnskkmhr/omnilrs_ros2_demo

The simulation allows user to interact with the Scene through ROS topics. This allows for instance to reset or teleport a robot, or to change the intensity of a light! We provide a complete description of the interactions available with the sim from ROS on the Wiki [here](https://github.com/OmniLRS/OmniLRS/wiki/ros_topics).

To use this simulation with SpaceROS, the ROS2 simulation docker must first be spinned up, and then in a second time, another container running SpaceROS must be launched to interact with the simulation.
To illustrate this, we provide a simple teleop demonstration with the sim in ROS2 and SpaceROS sending velocity commands. Check the Wiki for a [step-by-step guide](https://github.com/OmniLRS/OmniLRS/wiki#run-with-spaceros) on how to run this demo.

## Yamcs (Mission Control System) Integration
See the separate git repository to run the Yamcs and Grafana demo
